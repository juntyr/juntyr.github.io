## Abstract

χiplot is an HTML5-based system for interactive exploration of data and machine learning models. A key aspect is interaction, not only for the interactive plots but also between plots. Even though χiplot is not restricted to any single application domain, we have developed and tested it with domain experts in quantum chemistry to study molecular interactions and regression models. χiplot can be run both locally and online in a web browser (keeping the data local). The plots and data can also easily be exported and shared. A modular structure also makes χiplot optimal for developing machine learning and new interaction methods.
