Hi, I'm a Juniper, an environmental computing scientist.

Protecting our planet and the incredible species we share it with are very close to my heart. I use computer science to support solving these global problems.

I am working on using compression to reduce the data volume produced by weather and climate models. My focus is on using lossy compression safely, so without disrupting analyses on the data.
